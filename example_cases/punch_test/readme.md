This is a simple example of a punch test with a semi-spherical platter indenter. The mesh properties (e.g. particle mass and size) are taken from Thoeni et al., (2013) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compgeo.2012.10.014
For the macroelement itself, there should be no difference in the resulting force based on the size of the individual particles, since the model itself does not use the contact radius to calculate the force.
Their density / mass also depend on the mesh type, and should be calculated to have the same mass per area as the 'real' object
